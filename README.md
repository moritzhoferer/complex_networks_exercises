# Complex Networks course

These are non-graded coding exercises for the Complex Networks lecture by Prof. Frank Schweitzer at ETH Zurich.
I attended the lecture during the spring semester 2019.
Due to other duties of my PhD, I did not complete all exercises.
I attended the course for pure joy and out of curiosity.
Therefore I did not take the exam.

For the exercises, I use two different graph packages: `pathpy` (version 2) and `networkx`.

## Setup virtual environment

I recommend using an virtual environment and installing the required packages there.

First, setup and activate virtual environment of Python 3

```{bash}
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the required packages
```{bash}
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
